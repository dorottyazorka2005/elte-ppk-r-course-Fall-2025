# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail <- read_tsv("cocktail_data.tsv")
print(cocktail)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cleaned_table <- cocktail %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep= "<br/>") %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\(?\\s*\\d+\\.?\\d*%\\s*[Aa][Bb][Vv]\\s*\\)?")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(
    ingredients,
    "\\b(\\d+\\s*/\\s*\\d+|\\d+\\.?\\d*|half|quarter|a|one|two|three|four|five)\\s*(oz|ounce|ounces|ml|cl|cup|cups|tsp|tbsp|dash(?:es)?|drop(?:s)?|cube(?:s)?|slice(?:s)?|twist|part(?:s)?|barspoon(?:s)?|measure(?:s)?)\\b"
  )) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "[()\\d]")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients)) %>%
  filter(ingredients != "")

print(cleaned_table)
  
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_alphabetical <- cleaned_table %>%
  select(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(ingredients) 
  
print(ingredients_alphabetical)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
unique_ingredients <- length(unique(ingredients_alphabetical$ingredients))

print(unique_ingredients)
  
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
frequent_ingredients <- ingredients_alphabetical %>%
  count(ingredients, sort= TRUE) %>%
  filter(n >= nth(n, 10)) 

print(frequent_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktails_count <- cleaned_table %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients= n())

print(cocktails_count)

most_ingredients <- cocktails_count %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max(num_ingredients))

print(most_ingredients)
  
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cleaned_table %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(num_cocktails= n_distinct(name)) %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1)

num_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredients)

print(num_rare_ingredients)

rare_name <- rare_ingredients$ingredients

print(rare_name)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
